This is my pet project.

For 3 months, I worked part-time in the largest online school in Russia as a mathematics teacher. My responsibility was to take a free introductory lesson and, at the end of it, offer the student to buy the next one.

From the first day of work, I asked myself questions about consumer preferences of our students:

* who comes to extra lessons more often, boys or girls?
* which grade students buy most often?
* what day of the week and hour is the most successful for selling lessons?

In order to answer them, it took me three months to collect the data. I got a table with 200+ rows with columns: id, name, date, sex, grade, purchase.

In the notebook from this directory you will see answers to such questions and perhaps for yourself (or your school) you can increase sales based on my **data-driven decisions**.


**Stack:**

* Python (Pandas, Seaborn)
* Jupiter Notebook
